# Cloud Quizzer Alexa Skill
The project is my first published Alexa Skill Cloud Quizzer. Cloud Quizzer is a basic skill that provides a short quiz of Amazon Web Services.

## So what's exactly am I looking at here?
In this folder is the AWS Lambda code that executes when the skill is invoked by Alexa. It also includes the logo folder. I plan on adding some of the configs that were required to get the skil enabled later on.

## Test the Skill 
Test the skill out on your own Echo by enabling the below skill.
